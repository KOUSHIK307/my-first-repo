introduction What
is DevOps?
DevOps=Development + Operations
it's a culture + set of practices + tools that help:
*Developers(who write code)
*Operations(who deploy/manage systems)
*work together, instead of working in silos.

Real-time Example:

imagine you're building a mobile app like Swiggy.
*the Developers writes code to add "Track My Order" feature.
*Without DevOps: Developer gives code to Ops team-they manually deploy-bugs happen--delays.
*with DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed-customers get updates faster and safely.
